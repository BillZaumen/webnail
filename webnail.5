.SH NAME
webmail \- webnail file formats
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B webnail
allows its state to be saved in XML files that use the file extensions
.B xml
or
.BR wnl .
This file will be described below.
.PP
For configuring the
.B webnail
program, several additional files may be needed. The
first is a 'layout' file with an extension of
.BR xml .
This file starts with the following lines:
.PP
.B
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
.br
.B
<!DOCTYPE images PUBLIC "-//BZDev//Webnail_Layout_Info 1.0//EN" 
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "sresource:webnail-1.0.dtd">
.PP
All spaces after
.B !DOCTYPE
must be single spaces, not tabs, with this restriction applying
up to the second double quote.
.PP
The second is a template file, with an extension of
.BR wnt .
It starts with the sequence of characters
.B
$(!M.T application/x.webnail-template)
.R
which indicates that file's MIME type.  These files are passed to
the template processor provided by the BZDev class library, and
that template processor treats directives starting with an
exclamation point as a comment.
.PP
Both the layout and template files are described in the
Webnail manual, accessible from the Webnail program via the
"help" menu.  The remainder of this manual page will describe
the Webnail input-file format.
.SH XML INPUT FILE FORMAT
.PP
An XML input file provides more options than are possible using the
command-line interface.  The file must start with the following two lines:
.PP
.B
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
.br
.B
<!DOCTYPE images PUBLIC "-//BZDev//Webnail 1.0//EN" 
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ /"sresource:webnail-1.0.dtd">
.PP
The first line indicates the version of XML and the character set encoding.
The second line specifies the DTD file giving the input syntax for the
XML file.  URL's starting with "sresource" are interpreted by the program
as resources that can be obtained from the program's JAR file. In addition,
the first element,
.BR webnail ,
must contain an
.B xmlns
attribute with a specific value:
.B http://bzdev.org/DTD/webnail-1.0
.PP
The top level element is named 
.BR webnail ,
and it is defined as follows:
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT webnail (title?, descr?, head?,
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ header?, image*, trailer?, finalHtml?, webxmlExtras)>

.PP
The child elements are described below.  The attributes are defined
as follows:
.TP
.B windowTitle
This attribute specifies the title that will appear in the browser's menu bar.
.TP
.B mimeType
This attribute specifies the MIME type of scaled image files.  The
default value is "image/jpeg".
.TP
.B webMode
This attribute should be set to true if the output directory or zip
file should be set up for use with a web site.  The default value is false.
.TP
.B linkMode
When the value is true, for full resolution images and when the image
is specified using a URL, a link to the original image rather than
copy of the image is used it. The default value is false.
.TP
.B flatMode
High resolution images are not put in a sub-directory when webMode is
true.  If the images are not scaled and its MIME type matches the MIME
type specified by the mimeType attribute (or its default value), and the
original image is in the target directory, then the image will not be copied.
The default value is false.
.TP
.B highResMode
has a default value of true.  When it is false, high resolution images are
not included and the full-screen option for a slideshow will not appear.
.TP
.B webArchiveMode
When set to true (the default is false), the output will be a web-archive
file, or a directory with the same structure.  There will be a
WEB-INFO/web.xml entry that specifies how a web server should be configured.
.TP
.B zipped
When set to true (the default is false) the output will be a ZIP file
instead of a directory.  This option is ignored when a single image is
being scaled.
.TP
.B syncMode
This attribute has a default value of false.  When it is true, if an
image (e.g., one obtained from a web server) arrives late, the
duration over the image and subsequent ones are shown will be adjusted
to compensate for the delay.
.TP
.B waitOnError
This attribute has a default value of false.  When true, if images
were skipped because errors were detected while attempting to download
them, the skipped images' imageTime (the duration for which an image
should be displayed) will be added to the imageTime of the currently
displayed image.
.TP
.B imageTime
This attribute specifies the duration for which an image should be
displayed in seconds (three digits pass a decimal point are allowed to
specify time in milliseconds).  To specify times in minutes and
seconds, separate minutes and seconds with a colon. To specify the
duration in hours, minutes and seconds, separate hours and minutes,
and minutes and seconds, with a colon.  Thus, 1:0:20.5, 60:20.5, and
80.5 all represent the same value.  The default value is 10 seconds.
.TP
.B minImageTime
This attribute specifies the minimum duration for which an image should be
shown when syncMode is true.  The default value is 4 seconds.
.TP
.B bgcolor
This attribute specifies the background color used on HTML pages.
See the CSS specification for the syntax.  The default value is
"gray".
.TP
.B fgcolor
This attribute specifies the foreground (or text) color used on HTML pages.
See the CSS specification for the syntax.  The default value is
"black".
.TP
.TP
.B rvmode
When the value is "true", icons will use a light color suitable for
a dark background. When "false", icons will use a dark color. The
default is "false".
.B height
This attribute specifies the height of a bounding box for
full-resolution images in pixels.
.TP
.B width
This attribute specifies the width of a bounding box for
full-resolution images in pixels.
.TP
.B hrefToOrig
This attribute has a value of true or false.  When true, a default
value for the hrefURL attribute of each image element is provided, the
URL of the original unscaled image.  When false, the hrefURL attribute
defaults to a scaled copy whose bounding box is the height and width
attributes above.
.TP
.BR layout
This attribute specifies a layout for the web page. The value is an
a URL.  URLs that with the scheme
.B sresource
refer to standard layouts provided by
.B webnail
and indicate the location in the JAR file. Each layout has a name
that
.B webnail
will display in a Java "combo box", but the URL will appear in the
intput file.  The URLS and names are the following:
.br

.PP
The 
.B title 
element is defined as follows:
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST title
.br
.B
	  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The element's content specifies a title. When it appears as a child of
the
.B images
element, it specifies the default title to display below an
image. When it appears in an
.B image
element, it specifies the title for a specific image.  The value is
spliced into an HTML document. The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;",
or "&quot" should be used instead of the corresponding characters, or
the value should appear in a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA["
and "]]>".  Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The
.B descr
element is defined as follows:
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT descr (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST descr
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The
.B descr
element specifies a description, which is displayed directly below the
title.  When it appears as a child of the
.B images
element, it specifies the default description. When it appears as a
child of an
.B image
element, it provides the description for that specific image. The
value is spliced into an HTML document. The entities "&lt;", "&gt;",
"&amp;", or "&quot" should be used instead of the corresponding
characters, or the value should appear in a CDATA section (delimited
by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>"). Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The
.B head
element is defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT head (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST head
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
and its content will appear in the HEAD section of an HTML document.
The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or "&quot" should be used
instead of the corresponding characters, or the value should appear in
a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>".  This allows
various HTML elements to be added to the document head. Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The
.B header
element is defined by
.B
<!ELEMENT header (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST header
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
and its content will appear at the start of the
.B body
element in an HTML document. The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or
"&quot" should be used instead of the corresponding characters, or the
value should appear in a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and
"]]>". Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The
.B image
element is defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT image ((filename | url), title?)>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST image
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ mimeType  CDATA #IMPLIED
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ linkMode (true|false) #IMPLIED
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ hrefURL  CDATA #IMPLIED
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ hrefTarget (_blank|_top) #IMPLIED
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ imageTime CDATA #IMPLIED
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ minImageTime CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The children define a file name or URL for an image, and optionally a
title and description.
The attributes,
.BR mimeType ,
.BR linkMode ,
.BR imageTime ,
and
.B minImageTime
have the same meaning as the attributes with the same name do for the
.B webnail
element, but apply to a specific image.  The attribute
.B hrefURL
(if present) gives the URL to load when the image (not the thumbnail) is
clicked on the web page. The attribute
.B hrefTarget
indicates the corresponding target for the link, either
.B _blank
or
.BR _top .
.PP
The child elements
.B title
and
.B descr
were defined above.  The child elements
.B filename
or its alternative
.B url
indicate where to find an image.  The element definitions for these are
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT filename  (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ELEMENT url  (#PCDATA)*>
.PP
Both contain character data as their contents. The character data
provides a file name or URL respectively. Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
Next the
.B trailer
and
.B finalHtml
elements allow additional HTML to be added.  These are defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT trailer (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST trailer
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.br
.B
<!ELEMENT finalHtml  (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST finalHtml
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The contents of both give the HTML to insert into an HTML document.
The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or "&quot" should be used
instead of the corresponding characters, or the value should appear in
a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>".  Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided. For standard layouts, the content of
the
.B trailer
element will appear before the final
.B script
element, that appears in the HTML document by default and which loads
the file
.IP
.BR controls/slideshow2.js ,
.PP
and the content of the
.B finalHtml
element will follow that script.
.PP
Finally, the
.B webxmlExtras
element allows a web.xml file to be extended. This is defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT webxmlExtras (#PCDATA)*
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST webxmlExtras
.br
.B
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The contents of this element provides the XML to insert into a web
application's WEB-INF/web.xml file just before that file's closing
.B
</web-app>
element.
The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or "&quot" should be used
instead of the corresponding characters, or the value should appear in
a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>".  Alternatively, a
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.SH LAYOUT SYNTAX
.PP
Layouts are defined by XML files that should start with the following

selectable images.
.TP
.B t_hpad
Additional horizontal padding for thumbnails and the medium-sized
image beyond the amount expected from the marginw attribute (twice its
value). This additional separation prevents some browsers from placing
a scroll pane around an image and allows space for a border around
selectable images.
.TP
.B num_t_images
The number of thumbnail images visible in a scrollable frame.
.TP
.B t_vcorrection
Correction term in pixels for the thumbnail-frame height. This value
is added to the frame height that would be computed from the other
parameters. The default is zero.  This is not used unless the
thumbnails are stacked vertically.
.TP

locale-specific alternatives.
.TP
.B linkedURL
URL of the template for the HTML file to generate when the HTML file
contains absolute links for each image to a corresponding
higher-resolution image.
.TP
.B noLinkURL
URL of the template for the HTML file to generate when the HTML file
does not contains relative links for each image to a corresponding
higher-resolution image.
.PP
Finally, the
.B name
element provides a locale-specific name for the enclosing

.SH TEMPLATES
.PP
The attributes
.BR url ,
.BR linkedURL ,
and
.B nolLinkURL
defined above are references to templates. These URLs should end in a
name with the extension
.B .wnt
and the corresponding file should start with the string
.IP
.B $(!M.T\ application/x.webnail-template)
.PP
This string allows the file's mediat type to be determined from its
contents and will otherwise be ignored. It may be prefaced by a
byte-order mark, and should be UTF-8 encoded.
.PP
Template files use the following escapes and directives:
.TP

.B Comments
A directive whose contents start with
.B !
is a comment
.TP
.B Simple\ Directives
A directive whose contents contain letters, digits, and periods will
be replaced  with a value.
.TP
.B Iteration\ Directives
A directive consisting of two subdirectives, separated by a colon
.RB ( : )
with each subdirective consisting of letters, digits, and periods,
indicates iteration.  The first subdirective indicates a replacement
table to use and the second subdirective names a directive that ends
the iteration.  The text in between will be repeated N times, with
directives in the replacement table possibly changing from one
iteration to the next.
.TP
.B Conditional\ Directives
A directive consisting of two subdirectives, separated by a colon
.RB ( : )
with each subdirective consisting of letters, digits,
 and periods, with the first subdirective prefaced by
 .B +
r
.BR - ,
is a conditional directive. It is treated like
an iterative directive but with a single iteration that will occur
for the
.B +
case if the first subdirective matches a directive that is defined,
and for the
.B -
case if the the first subdirective does not match a directive that is
defined.
While some directives are used internally, the following ones are used
in templates explicitly defined for layouts, all of which are used to
create HTML files:
.TP
.B bgcolor
This directive has a default value of
"gray".  It specifies the background color used on HTML pages.
See the CSS specification for the syntax.
.TP
.B fgcolor
This directive has a default value of
"black".  It specifies the foreground (or text) color used on HTML
pages.  See the CSS specification for the syntax.
.TP
.B marginw
This directive provides the additional horizontal padding for
thumbnails and the medium-sized image beyond the amount expected from
the marginw attribute (twice its value). This additional separation
prevents some browsers from placing a scroll pane around an image and
allows space for a border around selectable images.  The value is
identical to that provided by the marginw attribute.
.TP
.B marginh
This directive provides the margin padding on each vertical side of
the frame containing thumbnails or the medium-sized image. This is the
marginheight attribute for a thumbnail and medium-image IFRAME>.
.TP
.B tWidth
This directive provides the a value computed
from the twidth, marginw and margin_hpad using the expression
twidth + 2 * marginw + margin_hpad.
.TP
.B tHeight
This directive provides the a value computed from the theight, t_vpad,
num_t_images, margin_vpad, and _vcorrection using the expression
((theight + (2 * t_vpad)) * num_t_images) + (2 * marginh) +
margin_vpad + t_vcorrection.
.TP
.B tWidth
This directive provides a value computed from the theight, marginh and
margin_vpad using the expression theight + 2 * marginh + margin_vpad.
.TP
.B tHeight
This directive provides a value computed from the twidth, t_hpad,
num_t_images, margin_hpad, and t_hcorrection using the expression
(twidth + (2 * t_hpad)) * num_t_images + * marginw) + margin_vpad/2 +
t_hcorrection.
.TP
.B iWidth
This directive provides a value computed from the mwidth, marginw, and
margin_hpad attributes using the expression mwidth + 2 * marginw +
margin_hpad.
.TP
.B iHeight
This directive provides a value computed from the mheight, marginh,
and margin_vpad attributes using the expression mheight + 2 * marginh
+ margin_vpad.
.TP
.B tdWidth
This directive provides a value computed from the twidth, marginw,
margin_hpad, and mwidth atributes using the expression twidth + 4 *
marginw + margin_hpad + mwidth.
.TP
.B tdHeight90
This directive provides a value computed from the theight, marginh,
margin_vpad, and mheight atributes using the expression theight + 4 *
marginh + margin_vpad) + mheight.
.TP
.B windowTitle
This directive provides the TITLE element in the HTML head.
.TP
.B head
This directive provides the HTML elements to add just before the end
of the HEAD element.
.TP
.B header
This directive provides the HTML elements to add after the start of
the BODY element.  The exact position is template dependent, but these
elements should appear before the trailer elements.
.TP
.B title
This directive provides the HTML elements to place as a title for a
medium-sized image.  There may be a default title and per-image titles
that can override the default.
.TP
.B description
This directive provides the HTML elements to place as a description of
a medium-sized image.  This will usually be below the title.  There
may be a default description and per-image descriptions that can
override the default.
.TP
.B trailer
This directive provides the HTML elements to place in the trailer,
whose exact position is template dependent, but suchelements should
appear after the header elements.
.TP
.B finalHtml
This directive provides the finalHtml elements. These appear after the
final script element in the HTML file and immediately before the end
of the BODY element.  This can be used to add additional
scripts. Putting scripts at the end of an HTML file when feasible
improves performance: a browser runs scripts sequentially and will not
load an image or style sheet while a script is running. As a result,
putting scripts near the start of an HTML file can increase the delay
before images referenced in the file are loaded.
.TP
.B repeatrows
This directive iterates over images.  The name reflects its use in a
template that generates Javascript, where a
.B repeatrows
block is used to construct an array initializer.
.TP
.B hrefURL
This directive provides the URL that will be visited when a medium-scale
image is clicked.  The value is changed during iteration.
.TP
.B hrefTarget
This directive provides a URL that points to the target frame
corresponding to the
.B hrefURL
directive.  The value is changed during iteration.
.TP
.B fsImageURL
This directive provides the URL of a full-scale image relative to
the top-level URL.
.TP
.B newTableRow
This directivive provides the HTML sequence needed to start a new row
in a table:
.B &lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;
if a row should end and an empty string otherwise.
