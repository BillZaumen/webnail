webmail \- webnail file formats
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B webnail
allows its state to be saved in XML files that use the file extensions
.B xml
or
.BR wnl .
This file will be described below.
.PP
For configuring the
.B webnail
program, several additional files may be needed. The
first is a 'layout' file with an extension of
.BR xml .
This file starts with the following lines:
.PP
.B
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
.br
.B
<!DOCTYPE images PUBLIC "-//BZDev//Webnail_Layout_Info 1.0//EN" 
.br
.B
                        "sresource:webnail-1.0.dtd">
.PP
All spaces after
.B !DOCTYPE
must be single spaces, not tabs, with this restriction applying
up to the second double quote.
.PP
The second is a template file, with an extension of
.BR wnt .
It starts with the sequence of characters
.B
$(!M.T application/x.webnail-template)
.R
which indicates that file's MIME type.  These files are passed to
the template processor provided by the BZDev class library, and
that template processor treats directives starting with an
exclamation point as a comment.
.PP
Both the layout and template files are described in the
Webnail manual, accessible from the Webnail program via the
"help" menu.  The remainder of this manual page will describe
the Webnail input-file format.
.SH XML INPUT FILE FORMAT
.PP
An XML input file provides more options than are possible using the
command-line interface.  The file must start with the following two lines:
.PP
.B
<?xml version="1.1" encoding="UTF-8"?>
.br
.B
<!DOCTYPE images PUBLIC "-//BZDev//Webnail 1.0//EN" 
.br
.B
                        "sresource:webnail-1.0.dtd">
.PP
The first line indicates the version of XML and the character set encoding.
The second line specifies the DTD file giving the input syntax for the
XML file.  URL's starting with "sresource" are interpreted by the program
as resources that can be obtained from the program's JAR file. In addition,
the first element,
.BR webnail ,
must contain an
.B xmlns
attribute with a specific value:
.B http://bzdev.org/DTD/webnail-1.0
.PP
The top level element is named 
.BR webnail ,
and it is defined as follows:
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT webnail (domMap?, title?, descr?, (user, password)?,
.br
.B
	  head?, header?, image*, trailer?, finalHtml?)>

.PP
The child elements are described below.  The attributes are defined
as follows:
.TP
.B windowTitle
This attribute specifies the title that will appear in the browser's menu bar.
.TP
.B mimeType
This attribute specifies the MIME type of scaled image files.  The
default value is "image/jpeg".
.TP
.B webMode
This attribute should be set to true if the output directory or zip
file should be set up for use with a web site.  The default value is false.
.TP
.B linkMode
When the value is true, for full resolution images and when the image
is specified using a URL, a link to the original image rather than
copy of the image is used it. The default value is false.
.TP
.B flatMode
High resolution images are not put in a sub-directory when webMode is
true.  If the images are not scaled and its MIME type matches the MIME
type specified by the mimeType attribute (or its default value), and the
original image is in the target directory, then the image will not be copied.
The default value is false.
.TP
.B highResMode
has a default value of true.  When it is false, high resolution images are
not included and the full-screen option for a slideshow will not appear.
.TP
.B webArchiveMode
When set to true (the default is false), the output will be a web-archive
file, or a directory with the same structure.  There will be a
WEB-INFO/web.xml entry that specifies how a web server should be configured.
.TP
.B syncMode
This attribute has a default value of false.  When it is true, if an
image (e.g., one obtained from a web server) arrives late, the
duration over the image and subsequent ones are shown will be adjusted
to compensate for the delay.
.TP
.B waitOnError
This attribute has a default value of false.  When true, if images
were skipped because errors were detected while attempting to download
them, the skipped images' imageTime (the duration for which an image
should be displayed) will be added to the imageTime of the currently
displayed image.
.TP
.B imageTime
This attribute specifies the duration for which an image should be
displayed in seconds (three digits pass a decimal point are allowed to
specify time in milliseconds).  To specify times in minutes and
seconds, separate minutes and seconds with a colon. To specify the
duration in hours, minutes and seconds, separate hours and minutes,
and minutes and seconds, with a colon.  Thus, 1:0:20.5, 60:20.5, and
80.5 all represent the same value.  The default value is 10 seconds.
.TP
.B minImageTime
This attribute specifies the minimum duration for which an image should be
shown when syncMode is true.  The default value is 4 seconds.
.TP
.B bgcolor
This attribute specifies the background color used in full-screen
mode.  See the CSS specification for the syntax.  The default value is
"gray".
.TP
.B height
This attribute specifies the height of a bounding box for
full-resolution images in pixels.
.TP
.B width
This attribute specifies the width of a bounding box for
full-resolution images in pixels.
.TP
.B hrefToOrig
This attribute has a value of true or false.  When true, a default
value for the hrefURL attribute of each image element is provided, the
URL of the original unscaled image.  When false, the hrefURL attribute
defaults to a scaled copy whose bounding box is the height and width
attributes above.
.TP
.BR layout
This attribute specifies a layout for the web page (index.html): the
attribute value are as follows (in all cases, the HTML text from the
.B finalHtml
element will appear at the bottom of the page, just before the end of the
document):
.br
.B normal
indicates the images will be displayed in a scrollbar with a larger view
in an adjacent frame, and provides navigation buttons and the ability to
show the images in a slideshow, with HTML text provided by the header and
trailer elements above and below the images respectively.
.br
.B headerThenImagesThenTrailer 
indicates that the images are placed in a
table whose number of columns is chosen based on the image size, with the
header and trailer elements providing HTML text above and belows the images
respectively.
.br
.B headerThenImagesAndTrailer
indicates that the HTML text from the header element
appears first on the page, followed by two columns, the first showing
the images (one image per row) and the second the HTML text provided
by the trailer element.
.br
.B headerThenTrailerAndImages
indicates that the HTML text from the header element
appears first on the page, followed by two columns, the first showing
the HTML text provided by the trailer element and the second showing
the images (one image per row).
.br
.B imagesAndHeaderWithTrailer
indicates that the web page should contain two columns, the first containing the images
(one image per row) and the second containing the HTML text from the
header element followed by the HTML text from the trailer
element. 
.br
.B headerWithTrailerAndImages
indicates that the web page contains two columns, the first containing
the HTML text from the header element followed by the HTML text from
the trailer element, and the second containing the images (one image
per row).
.PP
The domMap element provides a list of mappings, providing a key
that will be used in an image's 
.B property 
element, the ID of an HTML element, the name of a property of
the HTML element (the property names are defined in the Javascript DOM
documentation), and a default value for that property.
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT domMap (mapping)*>
.br
.B
<!ELEMENT mapping  EMPTY>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST mapping
.br
.B

.br
.B
	  id  CDATA #REQUIRED
.br
.B
	  prop CDATA #REQUIRED
.br
.B
	  defaultValue CDATA #REQUIRED>
.R
.PP
The attributes are as follows:
.TP
.B key
This attribute specifies a key naming the mapping. This will be used
in the key attribute of an image's property element.
.TP
.B id
This attribute specifies the id of an element.  The name matches that
of an HTML element's ID attribute.
.TP
.B prop
This attribute specifies the Javascript property whose value may be
modified.
.TP
.B defaultValue
This attribute specifies the default value of the Javascript property.
.PP
For example, a mapping might be defined as
.PP
.B
<mapping key="foo" id="div1", prop="style" 
.br
.B
 defaultValue="background-color: white" />
.PP
The 
.B title 
element is defined as follows:
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST title
.br
.B
	  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The element's content specifies a title. When it appears as a child of
the
.B images
element, it specifies the default title to display below an
image. When it appears in an
.B image
element, it specifies the title for a specific image.  The value is
spliced into an HTML document. The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;",
or "&quot" should be used instead of the corresponding characters, or
the value should appear in a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA["
and "]]>".  Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The
.B descr
element is defined as follows:
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT descr (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST descr
.br
.B
	  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The
.B descr
element specifies a description, which is displayed directly below the
title.  When it appears as a child of the
.B images
element, it specifies the default description. When it appears as a
child of an
.B image
element, it provides the description for that specific image. The
value is spliced into an HTML document. The entities "&lt;", "&gt;",
"&amp;", or "&quot" should be used instead of the corresponding
characters, or the value should appear in a CDATA section (delimited
by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>"). Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The elements
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT user (#PCDATA)*>
.PP
and
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT password (#PCDATA)*>
.PP
provide a user name and password when authentication is required. When
these elements appear as a child of an
.B images
element, they provide the default user name and password for any HTTP
request requiring authentication.  When they appear as a child of an
.B image
element, they provide the user name and password for a specific URL.
.PP
The
.B head
element is defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT head (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST head
.br
.B
	  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
and its content will appear in the HEAD section of an HTML document.
The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or "&quot" should be used
instead of the corresponding characters, or the value should appear in
a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>".  This allows
various HTML elements to be added to the document head. Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The
.B header
element is defined by
.B
<!ELEMENT header (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST header
.br
.B
	  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
and its content will appear at the start of the
.B body
element in an HTML document. The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or
"&quot" should be used instead of the corresponding characters, or the
value should appear in a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and
"]]>". Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.
.PP
The
.B image
element is defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT image ((filename | url), title?, descr?, (user, password)?,
.br
.B
	  property*)>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST image
.br
.B
	  mimeType  CDATA #IMPLIED
.br
.B
	  linkMode (true|false) #IMPLIED
.br
.B
	  hrefURL  CDATA #IMPLIED
.br
.B
	  hrefTarget (_blank|_top) #IMPLIED
.br
.B
	  imageTime CDATA #IMPLIED
.br
.B
	  minImageTime CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The children define a file name or URL for an image, and optionally a
title, description, user name and password, and a list of properties.
The attributes,
.BR mimeType ,
.BR linkMode ,
.BR imageTime ,
and
.B minImageTime
have the same meaning as the attributes with the same name do for the
.B images
element, but apply to a specific image.  The attribute
.B hrefURL
(if present) gives the URL to load when the image (not the thumbnail) is
clicked on the web page. The attribute
.B hrefTarget
indicates the corresponding target for the link, either
.B _blank
or
.BR _top .
.PP
The child elements
.B title
and
.B descr
were defined above.  The child elements
.B filename
or its alternative
.B url
indicate where to find an image.  The element definitions for these are
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT filename  (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ELEMENT url  (#PCDATA)*>
.PP
Both contain character data as their contents. The character data
provides a file name or URL respectively. Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided.

.PP
The element
.B property
provides a property value for a key defined for a
.B mapping
element defied above.  The 
.B property 
element is defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT property (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST property
.br
.B
	  key CDATA #REQUIRED>
.PP
The single attribute
.B key
is a reference to the ID, property name, and default value for a
Javascript object that is part of the HTML page's DOM. The
.B property
element's content is the value of the property to use for the current
image.  The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or "&quot" should be
used instead of the corresponding characters, or the value should
appear in a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>".
.PP
Finally the
.B trailer
and
.B finalHtml
elements allow additional HTML to be added.  These are defined by
.PP
.B
<!ELEMENT trailer (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST trailer
.br
.B
	  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.br
.B
<!ELEMENT finalHtml  (#PCDATA)*>
.br
.B
<!ATTLIST finalHtml
.br
.B
	  url CDATA #IMPLIED>
.R
.PP
The contents of both give the HTML to insert into an HTML document.
The entities "&lt;", "&gt;", "&amp;", or "&quot" should be used
instead of the corresponding characters, or the value should appear in
a CDATA section (delimited by "<![CDATA[" and "]]>".  Alternatively, a 
.B url
attribute can be used.  This attribute provides a URL that points to a
resource containing the element's content.  The element's content will be
ignored when a
.B url
attribute is provided. The content of
the
.B trailer
element will appear before the final
.B script
element, that appears in the HTML document by default and which loads
the file
.PP
.BR controls/slideshow2.js ,
.PP
 and the content of the
.B finalHtml
element will follow that script.
