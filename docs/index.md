# Webnail

Webnail

  - scale an image, placing the scaled image in a file.

  - scale multiple images, placing the scaled images in a
    directory or ZIP file.

  - create a web page containing multiple images with thumbnail images
    for navigation and with controls for providing a slideshow.

  - create a Web Archive (WAR) file or directory, with thumbnail images
    for navigation and with controls for providing a slideshow. In
    this case a web server (which Webnail also implements) can be used
    to allow multiple computers to show the same images concurrently.

To install, visit the [Debian Repository](https://billzaumen.github.io/bzdev/)
page and follow the instructions for setting up /etc/apt to use the
appropriate repository, and install libbzdev-base-java, libbzdev-math-java,
libbzdev-obnaming-java, libbzdev-graphics-java, libbzdev-desktop-java,
webnail, and webnail-pop-icons. For non-Debian Linux systems, there is
a [direct linkd](https://billzaumen.github.io/bzdev/packages.html) page
for downloading Debian packages, which the program `alien` can convert
into RPM packages, etc.  For other systems, visit the
[installers](https://billzaumen.github.io/bzdev/installers.html) page and
use the `bzdev` and `webnail` links to download installers (each is a JAR
file). Then follow the instructions on that page for running an installer.

## Documentation

There is a [manual](http:(https://billzaumen.github.io/webnail/manual.html),
also built into webnail as part of its 'help' system.

## Docker

There is a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/wtzbzdev/webnail)
available (wtzbzdev/webnail) that provides a web server that allows
multiple computers to show the same slideshow at the same time. The
web page for this server will provide the latest version number.
