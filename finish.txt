To integrate Webnail with a computer's window system, one will have to
set configure the window system to use Webnail's icons and to
recognize file extensions and MIME types.

In the webnail "doc" directory there will be two files: icons.zip and
mime.zip:

   * icons.zip contains PNG and SVG files for icons.  The path names
   start either with NxN, where N is the number of pixels along the
   edge of an icon, or with the word scalable.  Each of these is
   followed by a path-name component that is either apps or mimetypes.
   For the apps case, the last component to the pathname is either
   webnail.png or webnail.svg.  For the mimetypes case, the names
   of the PNG and SVG files, excluding the extensions, match the
   MIME type with the '/' in the MIMETYPE replaced with a '-'.
   Thus the MIME type application/x.webnail+xml would match the
   image files application-x.webnail+xml.png or
   applications-x.webnail+xml.svg.

   * mime.zip contains a single file: MIME/webnail.xml, which provides
   a file using the freedesktop.org format described in
   <http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/shared-mime-info-spec-0.18.html#idm140001680036896>.
   This file format specifies what patterns in a file and what file
   extensions suggest a particular MIME type.
   
   * desktop.txt contains the contents of the file normally named
   webnail.desktop (which is used by GNOME and KDE), as a guide for
   how to configure the windows system.
   

The behavior one wants is to (a) show the appropriate icon for a file
in a file manager window, (b) to allow the webnail application to be
easily started from a GUI, and (c) double clicking a file whose
mime type is application-x.webnail+xml (the preferred extension is "wnl")
should start the webnail application by running
       webnail --gui FILENAME
where FILENAME is the name of the wnl file.
